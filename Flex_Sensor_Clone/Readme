Starting off this will be a collection of links and notes that I am using to figure out how to do this

I bought a single one of the flex sensors from amazon to try to copy everything as closely as possible https://a.co/d/71oRMdE

I know that they use a polymer that includes a conductive material that functions as a resistor
My assumption is that it is graphite, as that is what most resistors use
I spent quite a long time trying to find a flexible graphite based conductive paint and came across: https://www.instructables.com/Make-Conductive-Glue-and-Glue-a-Circuit/
The ingredients are Graphite powder and Performix(tm) liquid tape
My guess is that most of the liquid electrical tapes are roughly the same so I ordered: https://a.co/d/jduQoU9
For graphite powder I know its not the absolute cheapest way but I bought: https://a.co/d/3LhQFSS

The sensor also uses what looks to be thin flexible copper, squares over the carbon at intervals, and a long thin peice to connect the end of the circuit back down at the bottom
To me it looks like copper tape, so I ordered: https://a.co/d/5afLK3H

Documentation on using paper as a pcb in the same way https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5259
main takeaway from that is solder joints are helpful for any turns, I plan to cut the copper in single peices so hopefully can avoid that causing flex issues

The sensor is also housed by a flexible plastic that has a return to shape being flat.
I saw numerous youtube videos where people created similar gloves with nothing but pencil drawn on paper, these all seemed okay, however I think they are going to have poor continuity on resistance measurments, and poor durability
The one I found the most interesting was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJNYbSpvlP8
This man used what the subtitles translate to perspex, to me this is called Transparancy Paper, my main memory of it is when i was in school it was used for Proximas, I also have used it for burning screens for screenprinting
I think using transparacy paper will work perfecly for my version of these sensors so I ordered: https://a.co/d/6Wk1T3B

Altogether my supplies not including the original sensor I am using to copy came in at $36.57
My assumption is this will be enough to make hundreds of these sensors, and currently 10 sensors (1 for each finger) costs about $200
I will update this as parts come in

UPDATE 1/23/24

Spoke with Grant of Mocap Fusion on discord, he had a request to try a design that included a 3rd analog point in the center of the band to better measure the seperate knuckles movements.
He sent a design which I have placed in the images subfolder to explain what he meant. In that he described the orange flex plastic as kapton. Researched that, it is polyimide. Transparency is polyester.
Found this article https://www.pcbjhy.com/blog/polyester-vs-polyimide/ 

Looks like the main differnce that would effect this use case is polyester is less moisture resistant which with sweat from hands could be an issue, but I think it should be fine.

Most everything is in

#testing out the official flex sensor did in fact confirm my earlier suspicions and lead to a very clear understanding of the design choices, which are very much about durability than anything else.

it is a long pad of graphite polymer painted directly on a polyimide film, segmented by 22 pads of conductive material, this looks like maybe silver or nickel polymer painted on top of graphite.
in between each conductive pad is a thin line of only graphite polymer.
This allows it to be very low resistance that only effects it at those points. The reasoning is very clear to me, it can be athick enough band of graphite to not fail quickly, but also remain in that resistance band that is effected reasonably well by stretching
otherwise you would need an extremly thin band of graphite, or it would have to be incredibly short at the width it is at.

The metal prongs are crimped through the plastic entirely, I assume because solder would block flexibilty and eventually fail
